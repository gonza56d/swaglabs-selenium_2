# Test automation challenge: Swag Labs

---

## Description:
Python test automation project for [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

## Rules:
- Use Python 3.7 or newer version.
- Use Selenium to automate [Swag Labs web app](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
- Use virtualenv, although it must be git ignored.
- Add dependencies in a requirements.txt file.
- The project must work with two different browsers.
- The project must run in Windows, macOS and Linux.
- The POM and [BDD](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html) patterns must be followed.
- One branch per work.
- Develop branch must be used.

## Encouraged:
- Follow DRY as much as possible.
- Selenium actions wrapper methods with logs are fully encouraged.
- Logs are nice.
- [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in parameters and return types are nice whenever possible.
- Documentation is always good way to be kind with your teammates and your future self (one-line comments and python docs).
- One fuction/method should do one and only one thing, and do it well.
- Environment (Non-test) errors shouldn't pass silently. Imagine the worst and raise exceptions!
